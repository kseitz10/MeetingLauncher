Meeting Launcher
================

Meeting Launcher is a small .NET 4.5 WPF application that launches Microsoft Lync meetings by 
getting data from your Microsoft Outlook calendar. Alternatively, you can manually add links
to your own recurring meetings. This is helpful mainly because network configurations (client
VPN) results in meetings that cannot be joined using the links in the calendar event. This
application "jiggles the handle" so to speak and makes the meeting launch under circumstances
where it normally wouldn't.

Supports Windows 7/8 jumplists and instant-join from the system tray icon. Probably doesn't
work well or at all on Windows XP. Haven't bothered trying!

Microsoft Outlook need to be installed, or you will need to disable/hide the Microsoft Outlook
integration from the settings screen.

(Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Lync are trademarks of the Microsoft Corporation, but you knew that.)
